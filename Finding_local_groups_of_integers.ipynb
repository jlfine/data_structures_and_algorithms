    "Supintegere we have an ordered list of integers, where some members of the list occur in proximity to each other. We wish to return a list of tuples, such that each tuple stores the first and last integer of each local group within the list of numbers. To define 'local' we can choose some offset, representing the maximum difference between two adjacent elements of a proximity group. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for instance, from the list of integers [0,1,3,6,9,50,53,56,70,100,110,120], we would like to return [(0,9),(50,70),(100,120)] in the case where our offset is 25. We will implement this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is particularly useful for slicing strings based on pre-defined indices, where integers can represent starting positions of adjacent substrings, and we wish to merge adjacent substrings."
